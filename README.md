# wine-alcohol-prediction
jupyter notebook and dataset used to research the best ways to predict the alcohol content in wine trained from an ICU dataset 

## Abstract
The project is intended to examine the UC Irvine white wine wine quality dataset via regression models using pycaret, and utilize alcohol percentage (the feature called alcohol in the study and thenceforth) as the target, in order to examine which features correlate most to alcohol, and which models produce the best fitted results. The results overwhelmingly showed in all cases that density (mass per unit volume of wine) has the highest correlation with alcohol. The study also showed catboost as the best model to achieve this goal, at least by most metrics.
